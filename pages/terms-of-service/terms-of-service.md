## Terms of Service

By using MinnowBoard.org website or any sub-sites you are agreeing to be bound
by the following terms and conditions here.

Here's the basic idea:

-	Don't violate anyone's intellectual property and post anyone else's copyrighted
    or confidential material you don't have permission to use.
-	Don't post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, illegal, etc.
-	Don't post spam.
-	Too many metalinks and tags are not accepted. If you try to boost your SEO,
    that's an abuse of the system.
-	Don't post just to sell something. Sure, talk up your project, but don't mention
    how to buy it every single time.
-	Don't launch into personal attacks. You're not going to agree with everyone,
    but name-calling will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.
-	Tone down the foul language. You can say what you need to say without relying
    on cursing. In fact, your writing will be regarded as that much more creative.

MinnowBoard.org is providing a framework for discussion and user generated
