## MinnowBoard MAX 

MinnowBoard MAX is the second generation MinnowBoard (released in July 2014), updating and replacing the original MinnowBoard. The MinnowBoard MAX board has an upgraded 64-bit Intel® Atom™; E3800 (Bay Trail-I) processor with better graphics and revised I/O, shrinks the footprint by more than half, supports additional operating systems (Linux*, Android*, and Windows*) and significantly improves on the original board on price, performance, and energy consumption.

#### LSE Layout

The Linux GPIO base address changed (by adding 256) from Linux kernel versions 3.17 to 3.18, so you'll need to know which kernel version you're using to select the correct GPIO numbers. This table lists the GPIO number for both the 3.17 and earlier kernels, and 3.18 and later kernels, for each pin on the connector:
