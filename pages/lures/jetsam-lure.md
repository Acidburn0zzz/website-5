**Note:** PCIe expansion cards can be added via the Jetsam lure:
By itself, Jetsam allows both half and full-height mPCIe cards

Full desktop-style x1 PCIe cards can be added via a mPCIe-PCIe adapter such as those available from:
[Amfeltec](http://amfeltec.com/adapters/), e.g. [Flexible MiniPCI Express to PCI Express Adapter](http://amfeltec.com/products/flexible-minipci-express-to-pci-express-adapter/)

Although the electrical interface only supports x1, cards with up to x16 physical connections may be installed via an adapter such as those made by:
[StarTech](http://www.startech.com/Cards-Adapters/Slot-Extension/), e.g. [PCI Express X1 to X16 Low Profile Slot Extension Adapter](http://www.startech.com/Cards-Adapters/Slot-Extension/PCI-Express-X1-to-X16-Low-Profile-Slot-Extension-Adapter~PEX1TO162)
