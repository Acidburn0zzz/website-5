#### Expansion Boards (Lures) Overview

For truly fast prototyping, explore expanding 
the base capability of your board by 
connecting breakout boards to either the Low Speed 
Expansion header (LSE - top side 26 pin connector) or 
High Speed Expansion header (HSE - 60 pin high 
density connector on reverse side of board). 

To do this, youâ€™ll need to purchase or design breakout
boards (Lures).
