For truly fast prototyping you can explore expanding 
the base capability of your MinnowBoard Turbot by 
connecting breakout boards to either the Low Speed 
Expansion header (LSE -top side 26 pin connector) or 
High Speed Expansion header (HSE - a 60 pin high 
density connector on the reverse side of the board). 
To do this youâ€™ll need to purchase or design breakout
boards, called Lures.
