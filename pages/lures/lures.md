## Expansion Boards (Lures) Overview

Breakout boards called "Lures" expand functionality of the MinnowBoard MAX 
by connecting to either the low- or high-speed expansion connectors. Lures 
are owned and supported by their respective owners and manufacturers. The 
community can give you best effort support; issues should be taken to the 
respective manufacturers and designers.
