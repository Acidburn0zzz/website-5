## Drone Lure

This is a relatively narrow board, originally, intended to allow the MinnowBoard MAX / Turbot to be used as the primary controller for flying drones (UAVs, quadcopters, etc). It has on built 15 PWMs (accessible via an I2C PCA9685 chip), status led (RGB), 6-axis accelerometer / gyroscope / compass, etc. Outside of drones, it's also been used for various non-flying robotics as well.
(**Note:** Lures are owned and

can only give you best effort support; issues should be taken to
