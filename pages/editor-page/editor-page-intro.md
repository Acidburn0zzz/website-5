# WYSIWYG...kindof

In GitLab, go to the page you want to edit, copy its contents, then
paste it into the "editor" tab on the right.

Edit, switch to preview, see if it looks OK.

When you're happy, CTRL-A, CTRL-C then paste it into GitLab.

**NOTE**: This won't work with images since the path here is relative
to the pages/editor-page/ and not to where your content is hosted. It's
just a quick hack anyway.

If it helps you, great. If not, patches welcome :)
