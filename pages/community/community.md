## Community

The MinnowBoard.org Project community is a collection of smaller communities, 
each with their own focus, needs, and methods for communicating.

The MinnowBoard.org Foundation is an Oregon-based non-profit dedicated to 
education and promotion of open source hardware and software for embedded 
computing. For more information, visit the [About](about) page.

MinnowBoard.org hardware projects are focused on open hardware--schematic board 
designs, firmware, and all of the necessary technical details surrounding the 
design and manufacturing of these powerful single board computers. For active 
discussions, questions, and answers, there is a [mailing list](http://lists.elinux.org/mailman/listinfo/elinux-minnowboard) as well as a 
web interface to the [#minnowboard IRC channel on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=minnowboard).

Are you using a MinnowBoard single board computer, or trying to get up and 
running with one? We love when users share their creations, ideas, and thoughts. 
You can post to or follow any of our social networking pages, on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/b/107232752308803303026/+MinnowboardOrg/posts),

our [Get help](help) page and weâ€™ll get back to you as soon as possible.
