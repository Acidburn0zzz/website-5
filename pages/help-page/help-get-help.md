## Get Help with Your MinnowBoard Board

MinnowBoard.org is here to help you have a successful experience with your board.
There are several ways to seek answers, including the preferred GitHub issues system.

### Submit a question on GitHub – the preferred method for getting help

We encourage users with general questions to post them to our GitHub MinnowBoard 
[bugs and help page](https://github.com/MinnowBoard-org/bugs-and-help/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=).
Posting here means responses are easily searchable and visible 
to a broad set of developers, including those developers not subscribed to our mailing 
list. All MinnowBoard-related topics are appropriate. If you don’t have an account, 
it’s free and easy to [create one](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).

### Search existing Github issues

Before you submit a new issue, take a moment to scan the existing bugs list in [GitHub MinnowBoard bugs and help](https://github.com/MinnowBoard-org/bugs-and-help/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue), 
enter a few keywords, and check to see if your question has already been answered by 
the community. Feel free to comment or reply to those issues that have already been 
posted to join the discussion.

**Note:** The [GitHub MinnowBoard bugs and help](https://github.com/MinnowBoard-org/bugs-and-help/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) 
list link takes you to the issues repository with the filters set to show both 
open and closed issues. The default issues filter is 
to hide closed issues, but you can use the direct link above or modify the issues 
filter.

### Ask a question via email web form

If you are unable to submit your question with the preferred Github issue submission, 
we have also provided the below email web form for quick questions. We will take the 
received question and post it to our GitHub bugs and help issues list so the larger 
community can benefit from the question and answer. We will also reply to you directly 
at the email address you provide. If you don’t provide an email address, we’ll take your 
question or comment as feedback. **Note:** If you provide an email address, we won’t use 
your address for any other purpose. See [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) for more information.
