The MinnowBoard mailing list has been in place since the first MinnowBoard design, 
and has attracted a group of expert community developers that not only pose great
questions, but also provide solutions. If you prefer, you can join the [MinnowBoard mailing list](http://lists.elinux.org/mailman/listinfo/elinux-minnowboard) and ask your question there.

### Warranty

Inquiries for technical support, warranty or RMA requests should be directed to the business or distributor from whom the product was purchased.
