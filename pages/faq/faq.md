## MinnowBoard FAQs

### 1.	What is MinnowBoard Turbot?
The MinnowBoard Turbot is a compact and affordable open source hardware platform 
that puts the power of a 64-bit Intel® Atom™ E38xx Series System on a Chip (SoC) 
in a small but versatile form-factor. There are dual and quad core versions. 
It is MinnowBoard MAX Compatible with 
upgrades to now allow you to accelerate product creation with regulatory assuredness. 
Visit the [learn more](learn-more) page for further details. 

### 2.	What does open source hardware mean?
As open source hardware enabelers, we support the Open Source Hardware 
Association principles by making our designs publicly available for the 
community so “anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the 
design or hardware based on that design.” (OSHWA).

### 3.	How can I buy a board?
The MinnowBoard Turbot, manufactured by ADI, is available from Netgate, 
Mouser Electronics, and Amazon. Visit the [Get a board](get-a-board) page for links and 
lists of required and optional accessories.

### 4.	What comes with the board when I purchase it?
The MinnowBoard Turbot ships as a stand-alone board, not including accessories 
such as a power supply or clock battery. This works well for many customers 
who already have the required accessories on hand; they don’t have to pay 
for duplicates and we don’t contribute to electronic surplus/trash. For 
customers without, some suppliers offer accessory shopping carts to purchase 
additional accessories at the same time. For more information, see the product 
details directly with the suppliers listed on the [Get a Board](get-a-board) page. 

### 5.	I have a question, where can I get it answered?

join our mailing list, or find links to our IRC, Google+, or Twitter pages. 

### 6. My MinnowBoard Turbot power LED is on but the board isn't working
There are two LEDs on the MinnowBoard turbot, as explained in the
[powering on tutorial](tutorials/powering-on-minnowboardturbot). 
The D1 LED is on whenever power is supplied to the board. The D2 LED indicates
if the SoC is powered on. 
If you plug in the board and the D2 LED blinks, that can mean accessories 
connected to your Turbot board are drawing too much power: the SoC tries to 
boot, draws too much power, and resets. Disconnect any extra accessories 
such as USB devices other than a keyboard or memory stick and try powering on 
again. If the D2 light does not come on at all, this can mean the board has 
been damaged by using a powersupply greater than 5V.
