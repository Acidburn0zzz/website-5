## About the MinnowBoard.org Foundation
The MinnowBoard.org Foundation is a US-based non-profit providing education 
and promotion of the design and use of open-source software and hardware in 
embedded computing on IntelÂ® Architecture. 

MinnowBoard.org supports the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA.org) principles 
and makes its designs publicly available so "anyone can study, modify, distribute, 
make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design." 

MinnowBoard boards are designed to offer exceptional performance, flexibility, 
openness, and standards. These embedded boards have an enormous range of capabilities 
for hardware, software, and firmware developers: from creating a fun hobby or 
professional maker project, to evaluating SoCs and developing high performance 
embedded applications or products.
