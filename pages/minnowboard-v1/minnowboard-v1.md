### Getting Started Resources

**NOTE:** The following guides are for the MinnowBoard v1 NOT for the MinnowBoard Max.

Here are some intro-level resources to help you learn about the (original) MinnowBoard and some things you can begin exploring with it. We also offer PDFs for convenient offline reading.

- MinnowBoard Basics [PDF version](https://github.com/MinnowBoard-org/design-files/blob/master/minnowboard-v1/rev-a/Getting-Started-Guides/Getting%20Started%20with%20the%20Minnowboard.pdf): This introduction will take you from unboxing your new MinnowBoard to learning about its components and features, and booting up the included Angstrom Linux OS image.
- Toggling a User LED on the MinnowBoard [PDF version](https://github.com/MinnowBoard-org/design-files/blob/master/minnowboard-v1/rev-a/Getting-Started-Guides/Toggling%20LED%20on%20MinnowBoard.pdf): The MinnowBoard has two user-controllable LEDs, and this guide will teach you how to manipulate them from the Linux command line.
- GPIO Programming on the MinnowBoard [PDF version](https://github.com/MinnowBoard-org/design-files/blob/master/minnowboard-v1/rev-a/Getting-Started-Guides/GPIO%20Programming%20on%20the%20MinnowBoard.pdf): This guide will show you how to make use of the 8 GPIO (general purpose I/O) pins on the MinnowBoard, which you can use to interact with external electronics.
- Physical Computing with the MinnowBoard [PDF version](https://github.com/MinnowBoard-org/design-files/blob/master/minnowboard-v1/rev-a/Getting-Started-Guides/Minnowboard-Physical-Computing.pdf): This guide will help teach you how to interface some basic electronic circuits (e.g, switches and LEDs) with the MinnowBoard's GPIO header.
