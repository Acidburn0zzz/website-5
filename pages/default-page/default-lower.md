# Minnowboard.org Foundation supports open source hardware

MinnowBoard hardware is designed to offer exceptional performance, flexibility, openness, and high quality standards.  As open source hardware 
enablers, we support the [Open Source Hardware Association](http://www.oshwa.org/) principles by making our designs publicly available for the 
community so "anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design." (OSHWA).{large}
