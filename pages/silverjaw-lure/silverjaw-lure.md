The Silverjaw Lure is an expansion board for the MinnowBoard Max that plugs
into the High Speed Expansion (HSE) connector on the bottom of the MinnowBoard
Max. It adds dual interfaces: mSATA socket and mPCIE socket. The Silverjaw Lure
provides switching power supplies (+3VDC & +1.5VDC) so it is very efficent and
minimizes the current draw from the MinnowBoard Max's main +5V power supply.

### mSATA

The mSATA socket interfaces to the MinnowBoard Max's PCI express bus which provides
a high bandwidth interface for memory cards. The MinnowBoard Max can be configured
to boot from the mSATA memory card. The mSATA socket supports both half-size and
full-sized mSATA memory cards.

### mPCIe

The mPCIe socket interfaces to the MinnowBoard Max's PCI express bus which provides
a high bandwidth interface for mPCIe cards. The mPCIe socket accepts the following
type of mPCIe cards: wifi, SATA drive interfaces, SD memory card, USB 2.0, USB 3.0,
RS-232 serial cards, etc.

**Note:** Tin Can Tools recommends using a +5VDC@3A power supply when using the
Silverjaw Lure with the MinnowBoard Max.

### Known Issues

#### Suspend / Resume disables PCI-E =

Suspending, and resuming, the MinnowBoard that the Silverjaw is attached to may
cause the device on the PCI-E bus to not resume correctly. Rebooting should resolve
the issue. This is because the soft reset signal isn't connected. This is expected
to be fixed in the Rev B of the Silverjaw boards (no current ETA)
