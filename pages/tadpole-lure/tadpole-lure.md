### Assembly

#### Getting Started

To assemble the Tadpole Lure, a soldering iron (15-30 Watt), some electronics solder, and a pair of wire cutters (to trim wires after soldering components). You should follow [good soldering techniques](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder---through-hole-soldering) to safely create a proper and lasting electronic connection.

#### R1 12 Ohm Resistor
There is a single resistor with the color code BROWN-RED-BLACK. This one is used for the resistor position marked R1.

#### R2/R3 68 Ohm Resistors

There are two resistors with the color code BLUE-GREY-BLACK. These are used for resistor positions marked R2 and R3.

#### R4/R5/R6 4.7K Ohm Resistors

There are three resistors with the color code YELLOW-VIOLET-RED. These are used for the resistor positions marked R4, R5 and R6.

#### RGB LED

The single RGB LED in the kit is mounted with the longest lead as the second hole from the side with a flat edge. The LED package has a flat side that gets matched up with the white line marking on the PCB.

#### Transistors

Three 2N3906 PNP transistors are included with the kit. Each transistor is mounted on the PCB with the flat side of the transistor matching the markings on the PCB.

#### Connector

The 2 row by 13 pin connector is mounted to the bottom of the PCB. The connector has a piece of plastic marking the "key side" that points to the outside of the PCB.
