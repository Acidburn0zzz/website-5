Now with built-in Wifi and Bluetooth

![MinnowBoard 3 - Top](pages/minnowboard-3/board-coming-soon.png){align-left} 

The MinnowBoard 3 is a compact and affordable open source hardware platform 
that puts the power of a 64-bit Intel® Atom™ E39xx Series System on a Chip (SoC) 
in a small but versatile form factor, with dual- and quad-core versions. 
Software is compatible with earlier versions and upgrades now allow you to 
accelerate product creation with regulatory assuredness. This embedded board has 
an enormous range of capabilities that appeal to intermediate and professional 
developers and OEMs interested in prototyping and bringing to market 
high-performance IoT and embedded applications and products. {large}
