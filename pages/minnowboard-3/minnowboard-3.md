The MinnowBoard 3 is a powerful, expandable developer board with integrated
wifi and bluetooth. This fully open source board with committed firmware 
and an easily modified 6-layer design gets you from prototype to production 
quickly. Its enormous range of capabilities appeal to innovators, professional 
developers, and OEMs interested in prototyping and bringing to market 
high-performance IoT and embedded applications and products.{large}

This first board of the MinnowBoard 3 series opens up the power and features 
of the Intel(r) Atom x5-E3940, four cores at 1.6/1.8Ghz, with 4GB LPDDR4 in a 
form factor and price targeted for broad market verticals, yet allows easy design 
modification to meet specific product applications. EMI/EMC is targeted for FCC 
Class B compliance, so you can easily achieve regulatory thresholds for your 
product. See the product details below for more information.{large}

Initial product launch is targeted for North America and Europe at Amazon, 
Mouser, and Netgate. Additional regulatory certifications and distribution geographies are targeted (TBD) for: China, India, Japan and Taiwan. Reach out to us with feedback, comments, and/or distributor 
recommendations directly through [Email](mailto:support@minnowboard.org) or on our [Get help page](https://minnowboard.org/help).{large}
