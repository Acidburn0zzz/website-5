## Getting Started
Congratulations on purchasing your new MinnowBoard Turbot! This is the landing page for developers who are taking their boards out of the box. We provide guidance on getting started, navigating the website content, and how to get help along the way. The MinnowBoard.org goal is for developers to prototype AND productize! Let's get started... 

### Components

To complete these steps you will need the following:

- MinnowBoard board

### Get a board
Visit [Get a board](get-a-board) to find the right board and accessories to support your project.


- **Buy a Board**: If you are on this page, you most likely have your board; if not, visit the [Get a board](get-a-board) page to find a list of available boards and where to buy them.
- **Buy Accessories**: Once you have your board, take some time to check out the optional and required accessories. Make sure you purchase (or locate) the items from the required list, and look over the optional list as well. To ensure compatibility, when purchasing follow the requirements listed with each accessory.

### Tutorials
Visit the [Tutorials](tutorials) page to learn how to power up your board and install an OS, and then explore other tutorials that will teach you how to use features on the board. 


- **Power up the MinnowBoard Turbot**: Walk through [these steps](tutorials/powering-on-minnowboardturbot) to power up your new MinnowBoard Turbot.
- **Update the firmware**: You shouldnâ€™t need to update your firmware, but just in case, this [tutorial](tutorials/updating_your_firmware) is available. Note: If you plan on attempting the [Installing Windows IoT Core](tutorials/installing-windows-iot-on-minnowboard-turbot) tutorial, you **will** need to change firmware from 64 bit to 32 bit.  
- **Installing Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS**: Despite its small size, the MinnowBoard Turbot can run desktop PC versions of operating systems such as Linux and Windows. This [tutorial](tutorials/installing-ubuntu-16.04-on-minnowboardmax) explains how to install a popular Linux release, Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS.
