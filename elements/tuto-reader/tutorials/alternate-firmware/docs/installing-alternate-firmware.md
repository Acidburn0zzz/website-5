## Installing Alternate Firmware

Here's a step-by-step guide to building coreboot for the Minnowboard MAX.

### Components

### Coreboot
Coreboot (formerly known as LinuxBIOS) is a free and open source extended firmware platform that delivers a fast and secure boot experience for embedded systems as an alternative option to using proprietary BIOS firmware. In contrast to a conventional BIOS, Coreboot initializes only the minimum required hardware (such as RAM, PCI, serial) and then executes additional payload boot logic for the rest. This two-stage approach helps achieve minimal boot times and a small footprint.

With the separation of hardware initialization and later boot logic, Coreboot can do the following: 

- Scale from specialized applications that run directly from firmware 
- Run operating systems in flash 
- Load custom boot-loaders 
- Implement firmware standards such as PC BIOS services or UEFI 

By permitting systems the ability to include only the features necessary to run the target application, code and flash space required are reduced. For further information, refer to the [Coreboot website]( http://www.coreboot.org).

The status on Coreboot's [Supported Motherboards](http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Motherboards) page indicates an unknown status for MinnowBoard MAX; however, mainline coreboot support for MinnowBoard MAX (by Sage Electronic Engineering) does exist, as shown on [review.coreboot.org](http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=coreboot.git). Coreboot supports booting from Serial ATA and USB 2.0/3.0. Booting from SD storage isn't working, and S3 suspend/resume support isn't working either. 

### Install the dependencies

  ``` 
  $ sudo apt-get install
  ```

  ``` 
  gcc git make ncurses-dev flex bison
  ```

### Get Coreboot 
For simplicity, put all downloads and items extracted into the same directory.

  ```
 	$ git clone http://review.coreboot.org/p/coreboot
 	$ cd coreboot
 	$ git submodule update --init --checkout
 	$ git checkout b9a0809faeeef67e46cda17cf8f7a839c6fe614c
 	$ wget https://minnowboard.org/tutorials/alternate-firmware/docs/Minnowboard_Max_Coreboot_config.txt
  ```

### Get Intel® Firmware Support Package (Intel® FSP)
1. Download either a Windows or Linux version, depending on the needs of your system:
    1. [Windows](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/embedded/software/fsp/atom-e3800-fsp-g3-windows-download.html){n}
    1. [Linux](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/embedded/software/fsp/atom-e3800-fsp-g3-linux-download.html){n}
    1. Archive [Intel® FSP for Intel® Atom™ Processor E3800 Series](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24496){n}
2. To extract from archive, follow the instructions in the Readme_Extract.

### Get Intel® Binary Configuration Tool (Intel® BCT) 
1. Download either a Windows or Linux version, depending on the needs of your system: 
    1. [Windows](https://edc.intel.com/Link.aspx?id=10034){n}
    1. [Linux 32-bit](https://edc.intel.com/Link.aspx?id=10033){n}  
    1. [Linux 64-bit](https://edc.intel.com/Link.aspx?id=10032){n}

### Setup Firmware Support Package
1. See [this guide] (http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/embedded/products/bay-trail/atom-e3800-minnowboard-max-platform-guide.html) for the most current info. The following is from an older version previously tested to work. 

  ```
  	$ cd bct
  	$ ./bct --bin ../BAY_TRAIL_FSP_KIT/FSP/BAYTRAIL_FSP_GOLD_002_10-JANUARY-2014.fd  \
  	--absf ../coreboot/src/vendorcode/intel/fsp/baytrail/absf/minnowmax_2gb.absf \
  	--bout ../minnowboard-max.fsp
  ```

2. If you have a single core MinnowBoard MAX, change `minnowmax_2gb.absf` to `minnowmax_1gb.absf.` It's not necessary to use the GUI; it does not work on every kind of Linux distro.

  ```
 	 $ cd ..
  ```
  
### Setup TXE and SPI descriptor 
1. First build a coreboot utility called ifdtool to be located within the coreboot directory:

```
  $ cd coreboot/util/ifdtool
  $ make
  $ cd ../../../
```

2. Accept the license and download the original [firmware binary]( https://firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard-max):

```
  $ mkdir MB_UEFI_Firmware
  $ unzip MB_UEFI_Firmware_v1.00.zip -d MB_UEFI_Firmware
  $ cd MB_UEFI_Firmware
```

3. Run “ifdtool” to extract the TXE and SPI descriptor from the firmware image:

```
  $ ../coreboot/util/ifdtool/ifdtool -x MNW2MAX1.X64.[version].bin
```

4. You should now have 4 files starting with flashregion_ . Use a symbolic link to link flashregion_0_flashdescriptor.bin to descriptor.bin:

```
$ ln -s flashregion_0_flashdescriptor.bin descriptor.bin
```

5. And do the same thing to link flashregion_1_bios.bin to txe.bin:

```
  $ ln -s flashregion_1_bios.bin txe.bin
```

6. You can safely ignore the other two flashregion files, as they won't be used.

### Setup Coreboot 

```
$ cd coreboot
```

In `src/soc/intel/fsp_baytrail/Kconfig` line 127, change 'string' to 'string "ME PATH"' `$ make menuconfig`and load provided config and save config to .config

- If you have a single core Minnowboard Max, change "Mainboard" -> "Memory SKU to build" to 1GB
- Set "Chipset" -> "ME PATH" to the directory containing TXE and SPI descriptor(../maxfirmware)

### Building 

```
  $ make crossgcc
  $ make
```

The firmware produced is `build/coreboot.rom`


### Building without TXE/SPI descriptor 

```
 $ make menuconfig
```

1. Set Chipset -> Include the TXE to `No`

```
  $ make crossgcc
  $ make
```

2. When flashing the firmware, flash only the last 3MB of the 8 MB image onto the last 3MB of the chip. Example command using flashrom and a dediprog: 

```
 $ echo 00500000:007fffff coreboot > regions.txt ; sudo flashrom -p dediprog -l regions.txt -i coreboot -w coreboot.rom
```

3. If you accidentally overwrite the first half, you will need to reflash the original firmware; instructions can be found in [Updating the firmware](tutorials/updating_your_firmware).
