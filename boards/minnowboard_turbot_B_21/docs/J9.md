# Connector: POWER

The MinnowBoard Turbot uses a 5.5 x 2.1mm barrel 5V power plug (+/- .25V or 4.75 - 5.25V).

**You must only connect a 5V power supply. The system is not 12V tolerant!**

Power supplies connecting to the system must be Center Positive, indicating that
the center (tip) of the output plug is positive (+), the outer barrel is negative (-).

A minimum 2.5A power supply is recommended. This allows for the following power characteristics:

* 500mA USB2
* 900mA USB3
* 500mA CPU
* 500mA Other peripherals

**NOTE:** If you try to power both a MinnowBoard Turbot AND a hard drive (spinning or SSD) off of the same power supply, please use a minimum of 3A supply, 
preferably 4A. Failure to do so may result in insufficient power to your system, causing it to reboot or power off unexpectedly.
